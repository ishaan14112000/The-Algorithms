# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is an <b>in-place stable</b> sorting algo. This sort traverses the elements sequentially and the elements are inserted at their required position in the sorted sub-array.This sort works on the principle of inserting an element at a required position, and therefore its name Insertion Sort.

This sorting algorithm is not suitable for large sized data due to its time complexity. Recursion has no/very little impact on the performance of the Sorting algo.

### Time Complexity:O(n^2)

### Space Complexity: O(1)
