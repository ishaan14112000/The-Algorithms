# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a <b>Divide and Conquer</b> sorting technique. It divides the array into two halves, calls itself for further diving until each array consists of a single element and combines them in a sorted fashion. 
It is one of the best and most used sorting algorithms.

### Time Complexity:O(n*log n)

The time complexity is same for all the cases i.e. worst, average and best because the merge sorting algo divides the array into two halves and linear tie is required to merge these two halves again.

### Space Complexity: O(n)
